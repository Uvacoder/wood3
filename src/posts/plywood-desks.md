I still had plenty of plywood scraps laying around so decided to make desks for the kids. â€‹

I bought plans from the [nicest woodworker in the southern hemisphere](https://paskmakes.com/) and went to work. I still had enough material for the base and drawer unit and only had to order the tops. I went with 37 mm birch plywood with a laminate top layer.

I had been using cheap mechanical pencils for years and was fed up with the lead breaking all the time. Marking on dark wood was also rather hard. Enter the Pica dry marker! ")

## Drawer units

I started making the drawer units first.

The drawers themselves are made of 10 mm plywood.

## Leg assembly

I used the miter gage on my table saw and a quick and dirty tapering jig to cut out the leg parts from 10 mm plywood.

## Table top

For the undercut bevel, Neil uses his table saw but I was not very comfortable doing it that way (one of the many laws of woodworking I abide by, don't make the cut if you don't feel comfortable doing it). I used my new tracksaw and overhung the track a bit. Worked mighty fine. This method can only produce 45 degree cuts of course. You could prop something under the track to make a bigger angle, but again, I was not very comfortable doing that.

<div style="display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
  grid-template-rows: 1fr; 
  gap: 0px 10px; 
  grid-template-areas:. . .; ">

# Final assembly
