Once you start building a workbench for yourself, you never stop with the first.â€‹

I had been working mainly on an old table top sat on an old rickety table. Being rather fed up with this, I set out to design a simple but very sturdy workbench. I drew heavily on the classic Roubo design (and learned Roubo was a French cabinetmaker).


![Workbench](/images/Workbench-1.jpg "Used reclaimed scaffolding boards to cut the legs and stretchers. Might be Douglas or Oregon pine. Smelled kinda soapy.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-2.jpg "Used way too much glue for the legs.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-3.jpg "Flattened and squared them up as best as I could using a plane. This sure is hard work.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-4.jpg "Straight(ish) and flat(tish).")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-5.jpg "Marked for the stretchers.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-6.jpg "Used half-lap joints.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-8.jpg "Starting to look like a workbench already! Glued and screwed the stretchers in place.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-9.jpg "In the end I opted for CLS beams for the top as I was not keen joining 20+ hand planed boards for the top.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-10.jpg "Cut of the rounded courners and almost destroyed the jobsite saw. Had to replace a bearing in the engine house.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-12.jpg "Glued up the top in two parts.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-13.jpg "And used just about enough glue.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-14.jpg "Had a huge cup in the top. Mental note: use cauls for the next glue-up.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-15.jpg "Used a home made router sled to flatten the top. Dust collection is key here if you do not want to drown in saw dust.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-16.jpg "Marked where the legs would go. Fitted simple leveling feet based on John Heisz' design.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-17.jpg "Simple joinery, best joinery.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-18.jpg "Drilled out most of waste using a Forstner bit.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-19.jpg "Cut the top fo final size.")

![Workbench](/images/Workbench-20.jpg "We have our first workbench! Oiled and ready!")

## Leasons learned
- Hand planing is hard
- A job site saw has its limits
- Be more careful with big glue-ups
- Done is better than perfect

## Still to do
- Add a bottom shelf to store my new Festool tablesaw
- Add a home made quick release vise
- Add dog holes
- Make scratches and dents all over the smooth surface
