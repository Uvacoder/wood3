Ripped a few reclaimed flooring boards into 10 cm strips to make a small garden fence.

Tried to apply the Japanese technique of _[Yakisugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisugi)_ (often called _Shou Sugi Ban_) but didn't have a strong enough burner. End result is not too bad I think.
Threw on a coat of boiled linseed oil for finish. Curious to see how long this will hold out.
