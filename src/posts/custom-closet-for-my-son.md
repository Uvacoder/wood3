New built-ins for my son's room, replacing a very ugly Ikea closet.​

# Design

Idea was to build it around his bed for extra snugness.

# Installation

## Material cost

Here's a rough breakdown of the material costs, excluding biscuits, glue and screws.

| Item                      |    Cost (€) |
| :------------------------ | ----------: |
| 18 mm MDF, cut to size    |      685.37 |
| Slatted bedframe and feet |      100.00 |
| Paint                     |      200.00 |
| Door handles              |       24.00 |
| Drawer slides             |        9.00 |
| Hinges                    |       40.00 |
| **Total**                 | **1058.37** |

The new lamp cost about 50€.

## Lessons learned

- For the love of God, don't ever try to make it fit so closely again.
- See above.
- Should've gone with more expensive black MDF instead of painting normal MDF. Painting makes the project so much longer.
