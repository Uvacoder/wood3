Here's a list of my favourite woodworking channels.

### [Ishitani Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7FkqjV8SU5I8FCHXQSQe9Q)

My all-time favourite channel to watch. Japanese furniture maker that makes you all zen. No talking, just beautiful shots of beautifully crafted pieces of furniture. Never seems to rush.

### [Mike Farrington](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAlXNfT2OV6CPu4ZQQmBmkQ)

Watch a professional cabinetmaker with the coolest and cleanest (seriously) workshop on YouTube. Insightful tips told in the most soothing voice of the States. Mostly customer projects that also include shots of installation. Lovely sense of humour.

### [Diresta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEk4xHBbz0hZNIBBpowdYQ)

The godfather of YouTube makers. Not your traditional woodworker, but a true maker with a plethora of skills like forging, welding, 3D-printing, leather working. His [tips videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnbHUsOu-Nfvc2bTj2FWiyzrOs_UkVxZH) are essential for any maker.
