Here's a list of my favourite woodworking channels.

### [Ishitani Furniture](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7FkqjV8SU5I8FCHXQSQe9Q)

My all-time favourite channel to watch. Japanese furniture maker that makes you all zen. No talking, just beautiful shots of beautifully crafted pieces of furniture. Never seems to rush.

### [Pask Makes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNyGbxoEo6CQvaRVEvItxkA)

Your friendly Australian woodworker, not afraid of making mistakes and revisiting old projects. Wonderful in combining metal and wood.

### [Mike Farrington](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAlXNfT2OV6CPu4ZQQmBmkQ)

Watch a professional cabinetmaker with the coolest and cleanest (seriously) workshop on YouTube. Insightful tips told in the most soothing voice of the States. Mostly customer projects that also include shots of installation. Lovely sense of humour.

### [Diresta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEk4xHBbz0hZNIBBpowdYQ)

The godfather of YouTube makers. Not your traditional woodworker, but a true maker with a plethora of skills like forging, welding, 3D-printing, leather working. His [tips videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnbHUsOu-Nfvc2bTj2FWiyzrOs_UkVxZH) are essential for any maker.

Canadian woodworker with a great sense of humour. Detailed explanations no longer on his main channel but accessible via his subscription based [Samurai Woodworking School](http://samuraiskills.com/). Maker of the coolest workbench ever.

### [Matthias Wandel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckETVOT59aYw80B36aP9vw)

No-nonsense Canadian woodworker with a very scientific approach. Loves to make his own machines and experiment with all sorts of jigs.
