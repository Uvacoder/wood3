Some tips I picked up along the way.

# Use spacers (or story rods) 

Ditch the ruler whenever possible as there is no way you can measure the exact same height twice (really). Ideal for drawer slides, ...

# Predrill before screwing
Always thought this was a wast of time, until I had a nice walnut piece split on me.

# Leave pieces long

Cut them to length as a final step.

# Drill a screw close to the border
Leave piece long, screw, then saw off next to screw

# Don't skip grits when sanding

# Design/build for the tools you have (access to)
