Some tips I picked up along the way.

# Use spacers (or story rods)

Ditch the ruler whenever possible as there is no way you can measure the exact same height twice (really). Ideal for drawer slides, ...

# Pre-drill before screwing

Always thought this was a waste of time, until I had a nice walnut piece split on me.

# Leave pieces long

Cut them to length as a final step. Or use a router with a flush-brim bit to flush everything up.

# Think of assembly when making plans

Always think

# Design/build for the tools you have (access to)

Really sucks if you have to plane a board that is 2 cm too wide for your planer.

# Buy tools as you need them

You really don't need all the latest, greatest and shiniest tools.

# Always mark your parts and dry fit before glue-up

For the love of God, dry fit.
