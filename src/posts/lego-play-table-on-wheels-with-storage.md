My first attempt at Ikea hacking.

Combined two Trofast storage units by adding 2 sidings and a top in 18 mm MDF, screwed on from the inside. Rounded over the edges to make it safer to touch.â€‹

Will mount two handles on the front face so we can easily pull it out from under the hanging cabinet that will be installed later.

Storage bins will be filled with Lego. Top will be used to place Lego creations on, so my son doesn't have to clear his floor of Lego buildings when it needs cleaning. That's the idea anyway.
