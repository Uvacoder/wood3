Made two display stands for vinyl records while waiting for the glue to dry on my [coffee table](https://www.fantomas-ls.com/en/blog/walnut-coffee-table).

Used salvaged beech to cut two test pieces as I wasn't sure about the 15 degree angle and if the base would be stable enough not to tilt.

Based on [this design](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/391531761352720801/). Turns out the smaller one tilted.
