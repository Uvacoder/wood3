Made a new walnut knife handle to replace broken plastic one.

The plastic knife handle broke off and I thought I'd be good idea to replace it with a walnut handle, as I have a ton of walnut scraps lying around after the coffee table builds.

Traced the shape on a blank, cut it out using the bandsaw and then glued everything together with 5 minute epoxy. Used a stainless nail for the pins.

Boiled linseed oil for finish.
