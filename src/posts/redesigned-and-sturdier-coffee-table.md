I redesigned the base to make it sturdier and wider. The previous [coffee table base](../coffee-table-base) was a bit too narrow and the design just looked off.

Made a new table top as well as this new one is slightly larger. Used dominoes instead of cookies this time. The masking tape is to prevent glue from spilling out.

First time at the lathe, really enjoyed this.

To keep the rails in place during glue-up I used a small finishing nail and cut off the top.

First coat of Danish oil. Really does make walnut pop.

Brass screws are the only option for this. Really.

Really happy I redesigned the coffee table and made it anew.
