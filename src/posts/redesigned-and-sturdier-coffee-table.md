I redesigned the base to make it sturdier and wider. The previous [coffee table base](../coffee-table-base) was a bit too narrow and the design just looked off.â€‹

Made a new table top as well as this new one is slightly larger. Used dominoes instead of cookies this time.

First time at the lathe, really enjoyed this.

To keep the rails in place during glue-up I used a small finishing nail and cut off the top. The masking tape is to prevent glue from spilling out.

First coat of Danish oil. Really does make walnut pop.

Attaching the top with some home-made table top buttons.

Brass screws are the only option for this. Really.

Really happy I redesigned the coffee table and made it anew.
