Last minute Christmas gift for my brother-in-law who just bought a new boat.â€‹

Printed out the name and then traced it on the walnut board using a hobby knife. Used pencil to mark the knife lines and then used a router and chisels to remove the letters. Some spray paint and lots of sanding later I had a nice gift.
