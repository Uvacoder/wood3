Replaced the temporary pine railing that was starting to rot after 6 years.â€‹

## Azobe

We had some rough cut azobe posts left over from our swimming pond construction and I thought it'd be a good idea to use them to replace the temporary stair railing that I made in pine and was starting to rot.

<div style="display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
  grid-template-rows: 1fr; 
  gap: 0px 10px; 
  grid-template-areas:. .; ">

<div>

![Plywood Crate](/images/azobe-railing/Azobe-railing-1.jpeg "Rough cut and not so very straight azobe post.")
</div>

</div>

</div>

## Installation

My original idea was to attach the posts like this but that didn't really work out as the thread was way too large and I couldn't get a wrench in to tighten the nut down. 

<div style="display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
  grid-template-rows: 1fr; 
  gap: 0px 10px; 
  grid-template-areas:. . .; ">

<div>

</div>

## Lessons learned

* Azobe is tough as nails.
* Use metal drill bits to predrill and go very slowly.
* Predrill with a big enough diameter as your screws will snap otherwise.
* I can break about 4 drills and 5 screws a day.
