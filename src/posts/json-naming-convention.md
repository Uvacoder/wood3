As we're getting more and more JSON files, a tip for all you developers.

Using a naming convention for JSON property names can speed up localization.â€‹

```json
{
"_id": "556se665255e324e",
"_type": "article",
"displayTitle": "Introduction",
"Title": "Introduction: Localizing JSON"
}
```

Don't want something translated? Start the property name with an underscore or use another naming convention you agree on.
