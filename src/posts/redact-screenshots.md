Quickly redacting and editing screenshots is now easier than ever. â€‹

On Windows, I used SnagIt for editing [screenshots](../android-iphone-screenshots-via-terminal) and on Mac I get by with the default editing tools from Preview. What I missed on Mac though is an easy way to blur parts of an image, for security reasons for example.

My brilliant colleague [Thibault](https://thibmaek.com/) pointed me towards [edit.photo](https://edit.photo/), a photo editor that lives in your browser, doesn't require an account, without any ads nor tracking. Almost sounds too good to be true.

Blurring parts of an image is easy peasy, simply drag and drop your image in the web app, select **Redact** and mark the part you want blurred.
