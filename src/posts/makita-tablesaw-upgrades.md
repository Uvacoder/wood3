Got my hands on a Mikita MLT100 tablesaw and here's what I did to make it a bit better.

## Fence upgrade

The standard fence is quite shite and flexes with even a minimal amount of pressure. It's also way too short.
I added some plywood to the existing fence and made sure it hooked across the back of the table for extra rigidity.

Added some cork for extra friction.

## Cross-cut sled

A must have for every tablesaw. Especially true for this one as the built-in sliding extension has too much play to be of use.

## Zero-clearance insert

Dust extraction is really poor on this saw. To help a bit I made a zero-clearance insert out of MDF.

## Cyclone dust extraction

Still testing out a prototype cyclone dust extraction system which hooks up to a regular vacuum cleaner.

Look! There's dust inside!
