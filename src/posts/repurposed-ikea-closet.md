Repurposed an old IKEA closet from work into a hanging cabinet to go above the [Lego play table](../lego-play-table-on-wheels-with-storage).â€‹

For the frame, I used the European equivalent of American 2 by 4s: SLS (Scandinavian Lumber Standard) lumber of 38 x 89 mm.

Had to resaw the doors and side panels and apply edge banding. Still need to do some caulking.

My wife painted the Lego playtable, which rolls nicely under the closet, if nothing is stored on top (never gonna happen).
