## Localization engineer turned agile quality assurance engineer

After 16 years in the [localization industry](https://www.yamagata-europe.com/) I'm currently working as an agile quality assurance engineer at [In The Pocket](https://inthepocket.com/).

## Woodworking

I spend most of my free time building [furniture](/tags/woodworking/) or reading.
